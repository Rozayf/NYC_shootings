# NYC_shootings
Mid boot-camp project 


 I want to tell a story about gun violence in the US.
 The US has a wide-spread and highly present problem with gun violence. In my case, living in Germany, 
 I cannot imagine what it is like living in a place where it is so common to hear of meaningless fatal shootings.
 Which is why I decided to look deeper into the topic. 

New York, for instance has stricter regulations when it comes to carrying and owning guns, then lets say, Texas,
so I would have expected to see a lower homocide rate in New York, which indeed it is lower, but it is still quite high considering the stakes.
 
New York has a death rate of roughly 6.
This means that out of 100 thousand people, 6 people fell victim to homocide in 2021. 
Although this may not sound too drastic, when put into perspective, that’s roughly 530 individuals from the total population of New York City alone, in one year, that lose their life due to homocide.
Now that’s alarming. Another statistic that I didn’t add on this slide states that the number of fatal car accidents and murders in NYC are roughly the same. So the likelihood of being killed in a car accident and the likelihood of being murdered, are roughly the same.

We see a general decreasing trend over the years, up until 2020, where from this time we see a 102% increase in shots and 133% increase in the number of fatal shots…
Could this be the impact of the pandemic? Being isolated on so many levels, mental illness, the lack of a sense of community and security? 

AND IF it is possible that the pandemic lead to such an incredible increase in gun violence, due to large restrictions in daily life,
this then leads me to the question: what are the other factors effecting and contributing to gun violence? 
It can’t just be only gun regulations, as we saw, the restrictions didn’t minimise gun violence in NY.. 

SO; To set the scene and pain a picture: Queens and Brooklyn are the largest boroughs in term of population.. 
so these  two do have similar sized populations and the Bronx has one million less people than Queens. 
So if Queens and Brooklyn have similar sized populations, why are the number of shootings in Brooklyn more than double those in Queens? 
And why is the Bronx, the second smallest borough, the second highest in terms of the number of shootings? 

To describe the scene even further, the Bronx and Brooklyn have the highest average poverty rate as seen on the left graph. 
(The original NYPD data considered race of the victim and perp, I decided to join relevant socio-economic statistics from other data sets and disregard the race factor from my analsis). 
So from the ammended data, we could see that the Bronx and Brooklyn have the highest number of households receiving benefits and Manhattan has the highest median income per household followed by Staten Island, 
where interestingly enough, the number of shootings were the lowest in those two boroughs.
It seems remarkable to me, that socio-economic factors are ignored in the original data-set. 
A decision tree model using the socio-economic factors was generated to predict the deadliness of the shootings in NYC. 
The accuracy of this model was 0.812


We can see that socio-economic factors do seem to play a role in the deadliness of shootings in NYC, according to the data we have seen;
Now we can look at some lighter statistics, that we were able to read off of the descriptive statistics. 
The number of murders by the time of day and the day of the week seems quite constant. 
While we see more shootings without deaths as night time approaches up until 4 am, and more on the weekend. 
This can be an indication that the intent to murder is quite irrelevant of the time of day and the day of the week, 
perhaps because passion and extreme emotions are involved that are not dependant on the time of day or the day of the week. 

Furthermore, more than half of the victims of gun violence are between 25-44, where as more than a quarter of the shooting victims were even younger,
between 18-24 and sadly in almost 10% of the shooting victims were under 18. This is a very depressing statistic that should not be overlooked. 
Also, although 3 % of the shootings were done by women, roughly 10% of the victims of gun violence are women. 
And lastly, Roughly 65% of the shootings in total were done in the street. Murders are also the most common in the streets.

So to conclude, we can all do better. 
The law makers but also we as individuals. 

The first is recognising social and economical injustice in statistics and daily life. This also applies to us living in the EU. 
This applies for education statistics, employment statistics, criminality statistics and so much more. We have to understand the effect of such injustices in so many areas of life. 
And lastly, this applies less to us, since we live in the EU where we are hardly confronted with the issue of gun violence in this magnitude,
but still we can speak up against gun violence in general and maintaining our strict laws.
